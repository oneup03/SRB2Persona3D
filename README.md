# SRB2 MusicPlus

SRB2 MusicPlus implements Lua functions for scriptable, gameplay-adaptable music. For SRB2 2.1.

## Lua Functions

* `S_SetMusicPosition(position)` -- set position in milliseconds
* `S_GetMusicPosition()` -- get position in milliseconds
* `S_DigitalPlaying()` -- is current song digital?
* `S_MidiPlaying()` -- is current song a MIDI?
* `S_MusicPlaying()` -- is any music playing (either MIDI or digital)?
* `S_MusicPaused()` -- is music paused?
* `S_MusicPause()` -- pause music
* `S_MusicResume()` -- resume music
* `S_MusicName()` -- get current music name
* `S_MusicExists(name[, checkMIDI[, checkDigi]])` -- check if musicname exists. Set `checkMIDI` or `checkDigi` flags to enable checking D_ or O_ lumps, respectively. Both flags default to true.

## Lua Hooks

* `MusicChange function(oldname, newname, flags, looping)` -- Get notified of music changes. 

Return true to not change music; false or nil to continue changing music; or return a string to override to another music name. Return an empty string to stop playing music. 

Optionally, this can output up to 3 values -- value #2 is the music flags to override (nil preserves the new flags), and value #3 is a boolean whether to loop or not (nil preserves the new value).

## Console Commands

TUNES is changed to allow seeking position.

* `TUNES [name] [track] [speed] [position milliseconds]`

Note that `TUNES -show` may not show the correct track if it was changed by Lua -- use `MUSICNAME` in this case.

Use the following commands by adding test_musicplus.wad:

* `MUSICHELP`
* `MUSICPLAYING`
* `MUSICPOS`
* `MUSICNAME`
* `MUSICEXISTS name [checkMIDI bool] [checkDigi bool]`

## Notes

Adding `test_underwatermusic.wad` demonstrates music-changing underwater if you warp to MAP07.

For a timing demo, add `test_musicplus.wad` and `PLAYDEMO test_musicplus-demo.lmp`.

### Network Safety

All Lua functions take `player_t` as their last variable, except `S_MusicExists()` which should be netsafe because it only checks for music lumps. 

To be net-safe with these functions, iterate through every player and pass each `player_t` object to the desired function. The function, if passed a non-local player, will bypass the internal music calls and return `nil`, in order to remain network safe.

It is unknown if the `MusicChange` hook is network safe. Again, if making any music calls, pass each `player_t` object to the call to attempt network safety.

### Technical Details

MusicPlus implements for SDL2, SDL1.2, and FMOD (srb2dd.exe). Compared to PLUSC, MusicPlus aims to provide a more feature-complete and stable solution for scriptable music.
